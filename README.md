This is the final project for [Python for Data Journalists: Analyzing Money in Politics](http://journalismcourses.org/course/view.php?id=52), a course offered by the 
[Kinght Center for Journalism in the Americas](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/). The 
project summarizes and plots the funding received by the various ballot measures from 
the November 8, 2016 election in California, as well as the voting results. The project's 
notebook can be seen [here](https://carlosror.github.io/CA_elections_2016/).
